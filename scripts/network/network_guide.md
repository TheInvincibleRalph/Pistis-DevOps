Let's walk through the script step by step, paying particular attention to the details such as the use of `SERVERS=("127.0.0.1" "google.com" "bing.com")` and `${SERVERS[@]}`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```
- This is called a **shebang**. It tells the system to execute the script using the Bash shell interpreter (`/bin/bash`), making sure the script runs as a Bash script.

```bash
# List of servers
SERVERS=("127.0.0.1" "google.com" "bing.com")
```
- This line defines an **array** called `SERVERS` in Bash. Arrays allow you to store multiple values (in this case, server IP addresses or domain names).
  
- **`127.0.0.1`** is the **loopback IP address** (local machine). This is useful for testing if your local network stack is functioning.
- **`google.com`** and **`bing.com`** are popular public domains, chosen here to monitor internet connectivity to external servers.
  
  You can modify this list by adding or removing IP addresses or domain names based on the servers you want to monitor.

```bash
# Log file to store the results
LOGFILE="network.log"
```
- This line defines the location of the **log file** where the results (ping status) will be recorded.
- **`network.log`** is a file that will be created or appended to in the current directory. You can change this path if you want to store the log in a different location.

```bash
# Ping each server in the list
for SERVER in "${SERVERS[@]}"; do
```
- This line starts a **for loop** to iterate over the array `SERVERS`.
  
- **`${SERVERS[@]}`** is the Bash syntax to access all elements of the `SERVERS` array. Here's how it works:
  - **`SERVERS[@]`** returns the entire array of server addresses (`127.0.0.1`, `google.com`, `bing.com`).
  - The loop assigns each element, one by one, to the variable `SERVER` during each iteration of the loop.
  
So, the loop will run three times: once for `127.0.0.1`, once for `google.com`, and once for `bing.com`.

```bash
    # Get the current date and time
    TIMESTAMP=$(date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
```
- This line gets the **current timestamp** using the `date` command and stores it in the variable `TIMESTAMP`.
  
- **`$(...)`** is a command substitution syntax in Bash. It executes the command inside the parentheses (`date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"`) and returns its output.
  
- **`date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"`** formats the date and time into the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`, which is human-readable and useful for logging when the ping was performed.

```bash
    # Ping the server (sending 1 packet and timeout after 5 seconds)
    if ping -c 1 -W 5 $SERVER &>/dev/null; then
```
- This line sends a **ping** request to the current `SERVER` in the loop.
  
- **`ping -c 1`** sends only **one ping** packet (`-c 1`).
  
- **`-W 5`** sets a **timeout** of 5 seconds, meaning the script will wait 5 seconds for a response before considering the server unreachable.
  
- **`$SERVER`** refers to the current server in the loop (e.g., `127.0.0.1`, `google.com`, or `bing.com`).
  
- **`&>/dev/null`** redirects both the **standard output** and **standard error** to `/dev/null`, a special file that discards all data written to it. This ensures that any output from the `ping` command (successful or error messages) is hidden.

- The **if statement** checks the exit status of the `ping` command. If the ping is successful (exit status `0`), the block inside the `then` clause is executed.

```bash
        # If ping is successful, log a success message
        echo "$TIMESTAMP - $SERVER is reachable." >> $LOGFILE
```
- If the ping is successful, this line logs the success message to the log file.
  
- **`echo "$TIMESTAMP - $SERVER is reachable."`**: This command prints a message indicating the current timestamp and that the server is reachable.
  
- **`>> $LOGFILE`**: The `>>` operator appends the output of the `echo` command to the log file specified by `$LOGFILE` (which is `network.log`). If the log file does not exist, it will be created.

```bash
    else
        # If ping fails, log a failure message
        echo "$TIMESTAMP - $SERVER is unreachable!" >> $LOGFILE
```
- If the ping fails (i.e., no response is received within 5 seconds), this block is executed.
  
- Similar to the success case, it logs a message saying the server is unreachable, along with the timestamp.
  
- The `else` clause handles any situation where the `ping` command returns a non-zero exit status (indicating failure).

```bash
    fi
done
```
- The `fi` ends the `if` statement, and `done` marks the end of the `for` loop. Once the loop is finished, all servers have been pinged, and the results have been logged.
