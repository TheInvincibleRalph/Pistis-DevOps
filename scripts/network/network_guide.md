# Detailed Explanation of the Network Monitoring Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```
- This is called a **shebang**. It tells the system to execute the script using the Bash shell interpreter (`/bin/bash`), making sure the script runs as a Bash script.

```bash
# List of servers
SERVERS=("127.0.0.1" "google.com" "bing.com")
```
- This line defines an **array** called `SERVERS` in Bash. Arrays allow you to store multiple values (in this case, server IP addresses or domain names).
  
- **`127.0.0.1`** is the **loopback IP address** (local machine). This is useful for testing if your local network stack is functioning.
- **`google.com`** and **`bing.com`** are popular public domains, chosen here to monitor internet connectivity to external servers.
  
  You can modify this list by adding or removing IP addresses or domain names based on the servers you want to monitor.

```bash
# Log file to store the results
LOGFILE="network.log"
```
- This line defines the location of the **log file** where the results (ping status) will be recorded.
- **`network.log`** is a file that will be created or appended to in the current directory. You can change this path if you want to store the log in a different location.

```bash
# Ping each server in the list
for SERVER in "${SERVERS[@]}"; do
```
- This line starts a **for loop** to iterate over the array `SERVERS`.
  
- **`${SERVERS[@]}`** is the Bash syntax to access all elements of the `SERVERS` array. Here's how it works:
  - **`SERVERS[@]`** returns the entire array of server addresses (`127.0.0.1`, `google.com`, `bing.com`).
  - The loop assigns each element, one by one, to the variable `SERVER` during each iteration of the loop.
  
So, the loop will run three times: once for `127.0.0.1`, once for `google.com`, and once for `bing.com`.

```bash
    # Get the current date and time
    TIMESTAMP=$(date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
```
- This line gets the **current timestamp** using the `date` command and stores it in the variable `TIMESTAMP`.
  
- **`$(...)`** is a command substitution syntax in Bash. It executes the command inside the parentheses (`date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"`) and returns its output.
  
- **`date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"`** formats the date and time into the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`, which is human-readable and useful for logging when the ping was performed.

```bash
    # Ping the server (sending 1 packet and timeout after 5 seconds)
    if ping -c 1 -W 5 $SERVER &>/dev/null; then
```
- This line sends a **ping** request to the current `SERVER` in the loop.
  
- **`ping -c 1`** sends only **one ping** packet (`-c 1`).
  
- **`-W 5`** sets a **timeout** of 5 seconds, meaning the script will wait 5 seconds for a response before considering the server unreachable.
  
- **`$SERVER`** refers to the current server in the loop (e.g., `127.0.0.1`, `google.com`, or `bing.com`).
  
- **`&>/dev/null`** redirects both the **standard output** and **standard error** to `/dev/null`, a special file that discards all data written to it. This ensures that any output from the `ping` command (successful or error messages) is hidden.

- The **if statement** checks the exit status of the `ping` command. If the ping is successful (exit status `0`), the block inside the `then` clause is executed.

```bash
        # If ping is successful, log a success message
        echo "$TIMESTAMP - $SERVER is reachable." >> $LOGFILE
```
- If the ping is successful, this line logs the success message to the log file.
  
- **`echo "$TIMESTAMP - $SERVER is reachable."`**: This command prints a message indicating the current timestamp and that the server is reachable.
  
- **`>> $LOGFILE`**: The `>>` operator appends the output of the `echo` command to the log file specified by `$LOGFILE` (which is `network.log`). If the log file does not exist, it will be created.

```bash
    else
        # If ping fails, log a failure message
        echo "$TIMESTAMP - $SERVER is unreachable!" >> $LOGFILE
```
- If the ping fails (i.e., no response is received within 5 seconds), this block is executed.
  
- Similar to the success case, it logs a message saying the server is unreachable, along with the timestamp.
  
- The `else` clause handles any situation where the `ping` command returns a non-zero exit status (indicating failure).

```bash
    fi
done
```
- The `fi` ends the `if` statement, and `done` marks the end of the `for` loop. Once the loop is finished, all servers have been pinged, and the results have been logged.

### Cron Automation

**Cron** is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems. It allows you to schedule tasks (called "cron jobs") to run automatically at specified intervals (e.g., every minute, hour, day, etc.). Cron is typically used to automate repetitive tasks, such as backups, monitoring, system maintenance, or running scripts (like the network monitoring script from earlier).

### Key Concepts

1. **Crontab**: The configuration file that contains the list of cron jobs for a particular user.
   - You can edit your crontab using the command `crontab -e`.

2. **Cron Daemon**: A background process (daemon) that runs continuously and checks crontabs for jobs to execute at the correct time.

### Cron Job Syntax

Each line in a crontab represents a scheduled job. The basic syntax for a cron job is:

```
* * * * * /path/to/command-or-script
```

This line contains five fields followed by the command to be executed. The five fields represent the following time intervals:

| Field      | Allowed Values      | Description                              |
|------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Minute     | 0-59                | Minute of the hour                       |
| Hour       | 0-23                | Hour of the day                          |
| Day of Month | 1-31              | Day of the month                         |
| Month      | 1-12                | Month of the year                        |
| Day of Week | 0-7 (0 or 7 = Sunday) | Day of the week (e.g., 0 = Sunday)       |

### Example Breakdown

```
*  *  *  *  *  /path/to/script.sh
```
This runs the script every minute.

Hereâ€™s what each asterisk means:
- **Minute**: `*` means every minute.
- **Hour**: `*` means every hour.
- **Day of Month**: `*` means every day of the month.
- **Month**: `*` means every month.
- **Day of Week**: `*` means every day of the week.

So the job runs every minute of every hour, day, month, and week.

### Common Cron Job Time Examples

| Time Schedule                | Crontab Expression           | Description                             |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Every minute                  | `* * * * *`                  | Executes every minute                   |
| Every 5 minutes               | `*/5 * * * *`                | Executes every 5 minutes                |
| Every day at midnight         | `0 0 * * *`                  | Executes daily at 12:00 AM              |
| Every Monday at 9 AM          | `0 9 * * 1`                  | Executes at 9:00 AM every Monday        |
| First day of every month      | `0 0 1 * *`                  | Executes at midnight on the first of each month |
| Every 10 minutes between 9 AM and 6 PM | `*/10 9-18 * * *`    | Executes every 10 minutes from 9 AM to 6 PM |

### Setting Up a Cron Job

#### 1. **Edit Your Crontab**
To open the crontab for the current user:
```bash
crontab -e
```
This opens a text editor where you can add your cron jobs. If this is your first time using `crontab`, it might ask which editor you'd like to use.

#### 2. **Add a Cron Job**

For example, to run the network monitoring script every 5 minutes:
```bash
*/5 * * * * /path/to/./network.sh
```
This tells cron to run the `network.sh` script every 5 minutes. Make sure to specify the correct full path to the script.

#### 3. **Save and Exit**

After editing the crontab, save and close the file. Your cron job is now scheduled.

### View Scheduled Cron Jobs

To view the cron jobs scheduled for the current user, run:
```bash
crontab -l
```

This will list all the cron jobs in your crontab.

### Cron Logging

By default, cron logs its activity (success or failure of jobs) in `/var/log/syslog` on most Linux systems. You can check the log to see if your cron jobs ran successfully:
```bash
grep CRON /var/log/syslog
```

If you want to log the output of your cron jobs to a specific file, you can redirect the output to a file. For example:
```bash
*/5 * * * * /path/to/network_monitor.sh >> /path/to/cron.log 2>&1
```
- **`>> /path/to/cron.log`**: Appends the output of the script to the `cron.log` file.
- **`2>&1`**: Redirects both standard output and standard error to the log file.

### Disable a Cron Job
To temporarily disable a cron job, you can comment it out by adding a `#` at the start of the line in the crontab:
```bash
#*/5 * * * * /path/to/network_monitor.sh
```

### Example Use Cases

#### 1. Backup Script
To run a backup script at 2:00 AM every day:
```bash
0 2 * * * /path/to/backup.sh
```

#### 2. Disk Usage Report
To run a disk usage report every Monday at 8 AM:
```bash
0 8 * * 1 df -h > /path/to/disk_usage_report.log
```

### Managing Cron Jobs for Other Users

If you are a system administrator and want to edit or list the cron jobs of another user, you can use the `-u` option with the `crontab` command:
```bash
crontab -u username -e   # Edit another user's crontab
crontab -u username -l   # List another user's cron jobs
```

### Summary

1. **Crontab**: The file where cron jobs are stored and configured.
2. **Job scheduling**: Define tasks using a five-part time field.
3. **Viewing/editing**: Use `crontab -l` to list jobs and `crontab -e` to edit them.
4. **Logging**: You can view cron job logs in `/var/log/syslog`, or log the output of a cron job to a file.
