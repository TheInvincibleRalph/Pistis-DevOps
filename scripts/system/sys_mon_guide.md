## Pattern Matching and Capture Groups

Let's evaluate this line from the script:

```bash
sed "s/.*, *\([0-9.]*\)%* id.*/\1/"
```

This line is performing **substitution** (`s///`), where it captures a specific portion of text and replaces the rest of the line with the captured text. Let's break it down step by step.

### `sed` Substitution Syntax

The basic structure of the `sed` substitution command (`s///`) is:

```bash
sed 's/pattern/replacement/flags'
```

- `pattern`: The part of the input you want to match and potentially replace.
- `replacement`: The text to replace the matched pattern with.
- `flags`: Optional modifiers for controlling the behavior (e.g., `g` for global replacement).

### What Are Capture Groups?

**Capture groups** allow you to extract a part of the pattern you're matching and reuse it later, typically in the `replacement` part of the `sed` command. Capture groups in `sed` are defined using parentheses `\(` and `\)`, and the captured content can be referenced later using `\1`, `\2`, and so on, for each capture group.

In **`sed`**, capture groups are numbered by the order in which the left parenthesis `\(` appears.

### Example of Capture Group in Action

Here’s the critical part of the command you're using:
```bash
s/.*, *\([0-9.]*\)%* id.*/\1/
```

Now let’s break this down:

1. **`.*`**: 
   - **`.`**: Matches any character (except newline).
   - **`*`**: Matches zero or more occurrences of the previous character (here, any character).
   - **Result**: This matches everything before the interesting part of the line (the idle percentage). 

   **Example**: In a line like `Cpu(s): 20.5% us, 5.0% sy, 0.0% ni, 74.5% id, ...`, this matches the `Cpu(s): 20.5% us, 5.0% sy, 0.0% ni,` part.

2. **` *\([0-9.]*\)`**:
   - **` *`**: Matches any spaces between the comma and the idle percentage value.
   - **`\([0-9.]*\)`**: 
     - **`\(` and `\)`**: Define a **capture group**. Everything matched inside these parentheses will be captured.
     - **`[0-9.]*`**: Matches a number (`[0-9]`) or a period (`.`), repeated zero or more times (`*`).
     - **Result**: This captures the idle percentage number (e.g., `74.5`) from the CPU usage line.

     **Example**: In the line `Cpu(s): 20.5% us, 5.0% sy, 0.0% ni, 74.5% id`, the capture group `\([0-9.]*\)` will match and capture `74.5`.

3. **`%* id.*`**:
   - **`%*`**: Matches a percentage sign (`%`), followed by zero or more spaces (`*`).
   - **` id.*`**: Matches the string ` id`, followed by any remaining characters on the line (we don’t care about the rest).
   - **Result**: This ensures that we are specifically looking for the idle percentage (the `id` field) in the CPU usage line.

4. **`\1`**: 
   - This refers to the first **capture group**, which in this case is `\([0-9.]*\)`, the idle percentage number that was captured.
   - The replacement part `\1` means that the entire matched line is being replaced with only the captured idle percentage number.

### Putting It All Together

```bash
sed "s/.*, *\([0-9.]*\)%* id.*/\1/"
```

- **Pattern**: 
  - **`.*, *`**: Matches everything before the idle percentage (including any spaces).
  - **`\([0-9.]*\)`**: Captures the idle percentage (e.g., `74.5`).
  - **`%* id.*`**: Matches the `% id` part and everything after it.
  
- **Replacement**: 
  - **`\1`**: This replaces the entire matched line with the captured value (the idle percentage).

### Example:

For this CPU line:
```
Cpu(s): 20.5% us, 5.0% sy, 0.0% ni, 74.5% id, 0.0% wa, 0.0% hi, 0.0% si, 0.0% st
```

The `sed` command does the following:
- **Match**: The pattern `.*, *\([0-9.]*\)%* id.*` will match the entire line, capturing the idle percentage `74.5`.
- **Replace**: The replacement `\1` replaces the entire matched line with just `74.5`.

This isolates the idle CPU percentage.

### Why Use Capture Groups?

Capture groups are useful in cases like this where you only want to extract part of a matched pattern, and ignore the rest. Without capture groups, `sed` would either match and replace the entire line or not be able to isolate specific parts like the idle percentage.

### Key Points About Capture Groups:
- Defined by `\(` and `\)`.
- Referred to in the replacement part by `\1`, `\2`, etc., based on the order of the capture groups.
- Allows you to isolate and manipulate specific parts of the matched text.

## Special Arithmetic Syntax `((...))` and  Calculator Language `bc`

Let's evaluate this line of code:

```bash
if (( $(echo "$MEMORY_USAGE > $MEMORY_THRESHOLD" | bc -l) )); then
```

This line is part of a Bash `if` statement that checks if **`MEMORY_USAGE`** is greater than **`MEMORY_THRESHOLD`**. To do this, it uses `bc`, a calculator that supports floating-point arithmetic, which isn't natively handled by Bash. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of the syntax and what each part does:

### 1. **`if`**:
   - The `if` statement starts a conditional block. In this case, the condition being evaluated is whether `MEMORY_USAGE` exceeds `MEMORY_THRESHOLD`.

### 2. **`$( ... )`**:
   - This is **command substitution** in Bash. Everything inside the parentheses (`$( ... )`) is executed first, and the output is substituted back into the expression.
   - Here, the `echo "$MEMORY_USAGE > $MEMORY_THRESHOLD" | bc -l` command is executed first, and its output is used in the conditional evaluation.

### 3. **`echo "$MEMORY_USAGE > $MEMORY_THRESHOLD"`**:
   - **`echo`** is used to create a string with the comparison `"$MEMORY_USAGE > $MEMORY_THRESHOLD"`. For example, if `MEMORY_USAGE` is `65.5` and `MEMORY_THRESHOLD` is `80.0`, it will result in the string `"65.5 > 80.0"`.
   - This string is passed as input to the `bc` command, which can evaluate arithmetic expressions involving floating-point numbers.

### 4. **`| bc -l`**:
   - **`bc`** is a calculator language that supports floating-point arithmetic, unlike Bash which by default only supports integer operations.
   - **`-l`**: The `-l` option loads the **math library**, which enables support for floating-point calculations.
   - The expression passed to `bc` (`"65.5 > 80.0"`) is evaluated as a **logical comparison**:
     - If the result of the comparison is true (`MEMORY_USAGE` is greater than `MEMORY_THRESHOLD`), `bc` will return `1`.
     - If the result is false, `bc` will return `0`.

   For example:
   - If `MEMORY_USAGE=65.5` and `MEMORY_THRESHOLD=80.0`, then `65.5 > 80.0` is false, and `bc` returns `0`.
   - If `MEMORY_USAGE=85.0` and `MEMORY_THRESHOLD=80.0`, then `85.0 > 80.0` is true, and `bc` returns `1`.

### 5. **`(( ... ))`**:
   - **`(( ... ))`** is a special syntax in Bash for performing arithmetic evaluations. It evaluates the expression inside the double parentheses as an integer.
   - In this case, it evaluates the result of the `bc` command:
     - If the result is `1` (true), the condition inside the `if` statement is true, and the code inside the `if` block will be executed.
     - If the result is `0` (false), the condition is false, and the code inside the `else` block (if there is one) will be executed.

### 6. **`then`**:
   - `then` marks the beginning of the block of code that will be executed if the condition evaluates to `true` (i.e., `MEMORY_USAGE` is greater than `MEMORY_THRESHOLD`).

### Putting It All Together:

1. The command `echo "$MEMORY_USAGE > $MEMORY_THRESHOLD"` creates a string like `"65.5 > 80.0"`.
2. This string is passed to `bc`, which evaluates the floating-point comparison.
3. The result (`1` or `0`) is then used in the arithmetic evaluation `(( ... ))`.
4. If the result is `1` (true), the code inside the `if` block will run. If it's `0` (false), the `else` block (if present) will run.

### Example:

Let’s assume:
- `MEMORY_USAGE=65.5`
- `MEMORY_THRESHOLD=80.0`

The line:

```bash
if (( $(echo "$MEMORY_USAGE > $MEMORY_THRESHOLD" | bc -l) )); then
```

would execute as follows:

1. `echo "$MEMORY_USAGE > $MEMORY_THRESHOLD"` generates the string `65.5 > 80.0`.
2. The string is passed to `bc`, which evaluates whether `65.5` is greater than `80.0`. Since it's not, `bc` returns `0`.
3. The expression `(( 0 ))` evaluates as false, so the code inside the `if` block will not be executed.

Now, if:

- `MEMORY_USAGE=85.0`
- `MEMORY_THRESHOLD=80.0`

Then `bc` will return `1`, and the `if` block will be executed.

### Why Use `bc`?

Bash itself cannot handle floating-point arithmetic in comparisons, which is why `bc` is used here. Without `bc`, you wouldn't be able to accurately compare numbers like `65.5` and `80.0`, because Bash would treat them as strings or integers, which would give incorrect results. `bc` provides the necessary support for comparing floating-point numbers.
