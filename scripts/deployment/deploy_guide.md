## `if` Statement and the Logical OR (`||`)

In the script, the **`||`** operator is used as a shorthand way to handle errors without needing a full `if` statement. It's a more compact way of saying, "If this command fails, then do this."

### Example of `||` (Logical OR):
```bash
cd $APP_DIR || { echo "Directory $APP_DIR not found"; exit 1; }
```
- **`cd $APP_DIR`**: Tries to change to the directory specified by `$APP_DIR`.
- **`||`**: Means "or". If the `cd` command fails (returns a non-zero exit code), then the script runs the code after the `||` (prints an error and exits).

This is effectively saying, "Try to change to this directory. If it fails, handle the error by printing a message and exiting."

### Using an `if` statement:
If you want to use an `if` statement instead, it would look like this:

```bash
if cd $APP_DIR; then
    echo "Directory changed to $APP_DIR"
else
    echo "Directory $APP_DIR not found"
    exit 1
fi
```
- **`if cd $APP_DIR`**: Runs the `cd` command and checks its exit status.
- **`then`**: Executes the block of code if `cd` succeeds.
- **`else`**: Executes the block of code if `cd` fails.

### Why Use `||` Instead of `if`?
1. **Compactness**: The `||` syntax is shorter and often preferred for simple error-handling cases. It's a one-liner instead of several lines.
   
2. **Readability**: For quick checks, the `||` syntax can be more concise and easy to read.

3. **Efficiency**: In simple scenarios like directory change failure, the `||` syntax is more efficient because you donâ€™t need a full `if` structure for a straightforward task.

### When to Use `if`:
You would typically use an `if` statement if:
- You have multiple actions or more complex logic to handle for success and failure.
- You want more control over how success and failure are handled, with potentially multiple conditions.

In summary, `||` is useful for quick error handling, while `if` gives more flexibility when handling more complex conditions. Let me know if you'd like further details!
