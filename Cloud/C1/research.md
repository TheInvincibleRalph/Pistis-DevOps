# Research Projects on Cloud Computing and AWS

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the internet (the cloud). Instead of owning and maintaining physical hardware and software, users access and manage these resources via the internet. This model contrasts with traditional on-premise computing, where organizations host and manage their own infrastructure and applications locally.
