##Task:

> *As a senior DevOps engineer at company ABC, analyze the existing on-premises infrastructure setup for legacy applications. Identify the challenges and shortcomings, including the single point of failure, lack of scalability, security vulnerabilities, and inefficient resource allocation. Propose a solution that addresses these issues by implementing a cloud-native architecture, separating the database from the application, migrating applications to the cloud while keeping the database on-premises, ensuring proper security measures, and eliminating single points of failure. Provide an architectural diagram illustrating the proposed solution and implement the steps in detail.*

## Solution:

### Challenges in the Current On-Premises Setup

1. **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**: Legacy infrastructure often relies on monolithic servers or systems that, if they fail, can bring down the entire application. Without redundancy, this is a critical risk.
   
2. **Lack of Scalability**: On-premises infrastructure typically lacks the flexibility to scale up or down quickly based on traffic demand, leading to overprovisioning (wasted resources) or underprovisioning (performance degradation).

3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Legacy systems may not have modern security measures like end-to-end encryption, multi-factor authentication (MFA), or automatic patching, making them vulnerable to attacks.

4. **Inefficient Resource Allocation**: On-prem systems often suffer from rigid resource allocation. Static provisioning leads to poor utilization, where resources remain idle during off-peak times but are maxed out during high-demand periods.

### Proposed Cloud-Native Solution

#### Key Aspects:

1. **Cloud Migration**:
   - **Lift-and-shift of application workloads** to a cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP), allowing for auto-scaling, automated resource management, and high availability.
   - Use **containers (Docker)** or **Kubernetes** for application deployment, enabling rapid scaling and portability.
   
2. **Database Separation**:
   - Maintain the **database on-premises** initially due to data sovereignty, compliance, or latency concerns.
   - Use **hybrid cloud architecture**, ensuring secure communication between the cloud-hosted application and on-premises database using a **VPN or Direct Connect**.

3. **Redundancy & High Availability**:
   - Eliminate the SPOF by implementing **load balancers** in the cloud, distributing traffic across multiple application servers.
   - Use **Auto Scaling Groups** to dynamically scale instances based on demand, ensuring high availability.
   - Implement **replicated databases** with possible future migration to a **cloud-hosted database** (e.g., Amazon RDS or Google Cloud SQL) for seamless cloud integration.

4. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Implement **end-to-end encryption** between cloud services and the on-prem database.
   - Use **IAM roles and policies** to enforce least-privilege access for services and users.
   - Enable **VPN encryption**, **firewalls**, and **MFA** for secure access to the cloud resources and on-prem database.
   - Ensure compliance with industry standards (e.g., **SOC 2**, **ISO 27001**).

5. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Implement cloud-native monitoring and logging tools (e.g., **CloudWatch**, **Datadog**, or **Prometheus**), tracking application performance, latency, and uptime.
   - Set up **automated alerts** and **self-healing mechanisms** to react to incidents in real time.
